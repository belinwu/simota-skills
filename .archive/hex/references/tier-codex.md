# Tier Codex

Canonical silhouette, palette, and motif for each of the 5 tiers. Use during the `ANTHROPOMORPHIZE` and `PROMPT` phases. The tier governs the base form; trait surfaces from `trait-mapping.md` overlay it without replacing it.

## T1 — Veil

- **Score**: < 1.0
- **Silhouette**: Small child-like figure, half a head shorter than a real human, faint translucent edges
- **Posture**: Hesitant, looking down, hands hidden
- **Palette**: Pale ivory, faint grey-blue mist, soft moonlight backlight
- **Motif**: A single floating ribbon or thread; the spirit barely interacts with the world
- **Aura**: None or barely-there shimmer
- **Environment**: Empty soft-lit space, hint of dawn
- **Tone keywords**: nascent, fragile, hopeful, unfinished

> Read: a healthy young codebase. The image should reassure, not threaten.

## T2 — Shade

- **Score**: 1.0–2.5
- **Silhouette**: Full-height humanoid, partial features formed; cloak or robe partially solid
- **Posture**: Upright but stiff; one shoulder lower than the other
- **Palette**: Cool greys, dusk indigo, charcoal cloak with faint silver thread
- **Motif**: A simple staff, broken talisman, or single bandage; the curse is starting to take form
- **Aura**: Thin smoke or vapor pooling at the feet
- **Environment**: Twilight, indistinct ruins in the background
- **Tone keywords**: emerging, watchful, weary

> Read: an aging product with manageable debt. The image is a polite warning.

## T3 — Wraith

- **Score**: 2.5–5.0
- **Silhouette**: Armored revenant, fully formed, ~1.1× human height, visible weapon or relic
- **Posture**: Combat-ready, rooted stance, one hand on weapon
- **Palette**: Charcoal armor with verdigris, deep oxblood inner cloth, bone accents
- **Motif**: A cracked sword, sealed prayer scrolls, lantern or eye-shaped relic; battle-scarred bearing
- **Aura**: Visible heat-shimmer or low embers, smoke trailing from wounds
- **Environment**: Battlefield ruin, twilight or eclipse
- **Tone keywords**: vigilant, scarred, dignified

> Read: a working production system carrying real debt. The image earns respect — neither cute nor catastrophic.

## T4 — Revenant

- **Score**: 5.0–8.0
- **Silhouette**: Hulking cursed body, ~1.5× human height, asymmetric build, multiple wounds
- **Posture**: Slouched but powerful, weight uneven; one limb visibly larger than the others
- **Palette**: Iron black, smoldering crimson cracks across the skin, sickly bile-yellow highlights
- **Motif**: Broken multiple weapons strapped to the body; chains; multiple seals trying and failing to contain it
- **Aura**: Heavy aura distorting nearby air; visible miasma; the ground around the figure is cracked or burning
- **Environment**: Storm-lit ruin, heavy ash falling, the architecture itself failing in the background
- **Tone keywords**: dangerous, accumulated, restraint-failing

> Read: a system where debt has begun to bleed into product reliability. The image should make the team feel an urgency to act, not despair.

## T5 — Calamity

- **Score**: > 8.0
- **Silhouette**: Deity-class composite curse, ~2–3× human height, often multiple heads or limbs, terrain-warping presence
- **Posture**: Either enthroned or rising; the figure is the center of gravity in the image
- **Palette**: Void black, molten core glow, ichor green or bone white accents, environmental color drained around the figure
- **Motif**: Crowns of broken seals, coiled chains being torn, multiple weapons fused into one weapon, eyes too many to count
- **Aura**: A localized weather pattern — eternal storm, frozen sun, ash spiral; the world bends around it
- **Environment**: The figure *is* the environment; landscape is a husk, distance falls into the figure
- **Tone keywords**: civilization-scale, mythic, dread, irreversible-without-coordinated-action

> Read: a system whose debt is now an existential business risk. **Confirm with the user before publishing.** The image is a deliberately unsettling diagnostic — useful for budget conversations, harmful as a meme.

## Cross-Tier Visual Continuity

The same character archetype evolves across tiers — same silhouette family, same garment vocabulary, same color anchors that darken and amplify with each tier. When comparing snapshots over time, hold the silhouette's identity (shoulder line, mask shape, weapon type) constant and let the deformation, palette, and aura tell the change story.

## Style Anchors (Image Generation)

These keywords go into every prompt regardless of tier:

- `mythic dark fantasy`
- `painterly`, `dramatic chiaroscuro lighting`
- `single character, full body, three-quarter view`
- `painted concept art`; for T1–T2 lean on `ethereal negative space` and `classical fantasy painting tradition`; for T3+ lean on `dense detailed linework` and `dark heroic fantasy illustration tradition`
- `centered composition, neutral environment`, `clean background`

Avoid:

- modern brand cues, photographs, generic anime moe styling, cartoon comedy
- gore-for-gore-sake; never sexualized
- text or letters on the character (keeps the image localizable)

## Aspect Ratio and Resolution

- Default: `2:3` portrait (suits a single-character full-body shot)
- For dashboards / banners: `16:9` may be requested by the user; pad with environmental haze rather than upscaling the figure
- Resolution: 1024×1536 baseline, 2048×3072 (or native 4K when Nano Banana Pro is selected) if downstream Sketch invocation supports it. Nano Banana 2 / Pro (released 2026-02-26) advertises 4K output and improved style-consistency across up to 14 reference images — useful when comparing evolution snapshots across quarters.

## Tier Confirmation Checklist

Before composing the prompt, verify:

- [ ] Tier matches the formula in `severity-rubric.md` (no gut-feel override)
- [ ] Silhouette family fits the tier
- [ ] Palette anchors taken from the tier (not arbitrary)
- [ ] Motif inventory drawn from this codex
- [ ] Trait surfaces from `trait-mapping.md` overlay without contradicting the tier
